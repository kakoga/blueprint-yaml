    question: How often should I brush my dog or cat's teeth?
    answer: It's important to start the habit when they are young and get them used to the feel of a toothbrush. Ideally, a daily brushing for dogs, and every other day for cats. Ask your veterinarian for tips on how to train your pet to get used to this routine.
